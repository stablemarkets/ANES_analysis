### Okay so here's the claim: 
## "Remarkably, white liberals were the only subgroup exhibiting a 
## pro-outgroup biasâ€”meaning white liberals were more favorable toward nonwhites
## and are the only group to show this preference for group other than 
## their own."

## Conclusion: well...no. First, "asian" liberals also meet this
## standard with net score of 0. But this is dubious...we only havae 20 liberal
## asians in our sample so let's not draw any conclusions. 
## Second, the variability is so huge. Look at the whiskers on these boxplots, 
## look at all the spread. If we were to take a different survey, we may have 
## gotten different results - just a ton of variability her. with a lot of  
## outliers (especially among whites). So "means" aren't even a good measure 
## of central tendency here. What would be better are medians. And difference 
## in median scores are much narrow. 
## So i don't think this data really support the claim. 


## we need to account for survey sampling weights for population-level
## inference. E.g. if we under-sampled asians by say 20%, each asian's score 
## should really be score*1.2, weight 1.2 being the weight. Lucily, we're 
## given the survey weights. 

ggplot(dd, aes(x = race, y = score*weight, fill=liberal) ) + 
  geom_boxplot( position = position_dodge()) + 
  geom_abline( intercept=0, slope=0, linetype='dashed', col='red', show.legend = F) + 
  ylim(-100,100) + 
  theme_bw()

## okay...still a ton of variation...even more variation on liberal asians, 
## but not much different.
